# Bank Customer Churn & Segmentation Analysis:


This analysis was conducted to uncover key insights into customer churn, demographic profiles, geographical behavior differences, and customer segments within the bankâ€™s customer base.

## 1. Churn Characteristics & Predictability
- Analysis revealed that customers who churned (Exited = 1) often exhibit:

- Lower Credit Scores

- Higher Account Balances (often unused funds)

- Fewer Products Held (typically 1 product)

- Lower Activity Rates (non-active members)

- Shorter Tenure (shorter relationship with the bank)

These patterns suggest churn is strongly linked to customer disengagement and credit risk factors.
Preliminary modeling indicates that variables such as Credit Score, Balance, Tenure, Number of Products, and Activity Status can effectively predict churn risk, highlighting potential for churn-prevention targeting.

## 2. Overall Customer Demographics
The customer base is diverse in terms of:

- Age: Wide spread with notable concentrations in the mid-30s to late-40s range.

- Gender: Fairly balanced male-to-female ratio.

- Geography: Primarily from France, followed by Germany and Spain.

Estimated Salary & Balance: 

- Customers span a broad range of income and account balances, with some outliers holding significantly high balances.

## 3. Differences Across Germany, France, and Spain
Distinct behavioral differences were observed among customers in the three regions:

- German Customers: Higher average churn rate, with moderate balances and product usage.

- French Customers: Lower churn rates, generally higher balances, and longer tenure on average.

- Spanish Customers: Moderate churn rates with lower product usage and moderate account activity.

These variations suggest that localized strategies may be necessary to optimize retention efforts across regions.

## 4. Customer Segments Identified
The analysis identified several clear customer segments:

- High-Value Loyalists: High credit scores, high balances, longer tenure, and low churn risk.

- At-Risk Disengaged Customers: Low activity, low product usage, shorter tenure, and high churn risk.

- Moderate Users: Customers with average balances and product use, representing stable but potentially underserved groups.

These segments can guide targeted marketing, retention campaigns, and product development strategies to better meet customer needs and reduce churn.

## Conclusion:

The analysis highlights actionable insights into customer behaviors, risks, and opportunities for segmentation-based strategies. Focusing on early intervention for at-risk segments and leveraging geographic differences will be critical to improving customer retention and engagement.
